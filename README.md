# Torrada Demo

A beautiful demo using React, TypeScript, and Vite to showcase the features of the Torrada toast library.

## About the Project

This project demonstrates how to integrate and customize toast notifications using the [Torrada](https://www.npmjs.com/package/torrada) library. It includes interactive examples of different toast types, position control, async updates, and easy integration with your React app.

## Main Features

- **Interactive Toasts**: Success, error, warning, and info notifications.
- **Position Control**: Choose where toasts appear on the screen.
- **Async Updates**: Demonstrates updating a toast during async operations.
- **Customizable Design**: Modern styles with Tailwind CSS and animations.
- **Reusable Components**: Buttons, cards, and ready-to-use layouts.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
2. Start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
3. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Project Structure

- `src/App.tsx`: Main page and toast controls integration.
- `src/components/`: Reusable components (button, card, toast controls, position, async, etc).
- `src/index.css`: Global styles, themes, and Tailwind customizations.
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite configuration.

## Customization

- Toast and component styles can be easily adjusted via Tailwind and CSS variables.
- To use Torrada in your project, simply import the hooks and components as shown in `App.tsx`.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds for production.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint.
